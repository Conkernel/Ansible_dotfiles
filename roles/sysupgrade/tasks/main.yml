  # Since community.general 5.0.0 the 'changed' state of this call
  # will be 'true' in case the cache was updated, or when a package
  # was updated.

  # The previous behavior was to only indicate whether something was
  # upgraded. To keep the old behavior, add the following to the task:
  #
  #   register: result
  #   changed_when: result.packages | length > 0


# -y, --refresh
# -u, --upgrades
# -S, --sync (instala)
